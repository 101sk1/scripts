# Universal Esp  
Updated June 23, 2021  
v1.4.0  
- Box Esp  
- Tracers  
- Name Esp (with Distance and Health and Display Name) 
- Skeleton Esp   
- Look Tracers  
  
```
https://pastebin.com/raw/5zw0rLH9
```  
  
**NOTICE**  
```
You are allowed to use this ESP in your script as long as you credit me (zzerexx or zzerexx#3970)
```  
  
## Update v1.4.0  
Added Look Tracers  
Draws a line that shows where the player is looking  
Similar to the lines you see while observing in csgo/valorant  
Notes:
- This is based on the player's head cframe, so its not actually showing their cursor position  
- Both the head and look position must be on-screen to make the tracer visible (might change this in the future)
