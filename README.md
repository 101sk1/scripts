# Synapse to Script-Ware  
Updated May 31, 2021  
Allows you to use Synapse exclusive functions with Script-Ware v2  
**Usage**  
```lua
local syn = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zzerexx/scripts/main/SynapseToScriptWare.lua", true))()
function getsynasset(path)
	return getcustomasset(path)
end
```  
  
**Example**    
```lua
local syn = loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zzerexx/scripts/main/SynapseToScriptWare.lua", true))()
function getsynasset(path) -- this is only needed if you want to use getsynasset
	return getcustomasset(path)
end

local enc = syn.crypt.custom.encrypt(
	"aes-gcm",
	"hi gamers!",
	"$nLliCMdi7gcynsFCK9u0aVNdtkNIiZG",
	"Agd13KuKIL2$")

print(enc) -- iQg5LoK5GmWmkO7HtuHH4Q==

local dec = syn.crypt.custom.decrypt(
	"aes-gcm",
	enc,
	"$nLliCMdi7gcynsFCK9u0aVNdtkNIiZG",
	"Agd13KuKIL2$"
)

print(dec) -- hi gamers!
```  

**Notes**  
`syn.secure_call` and `syn.create_secure_function` and `syn.run_secure_function` are not available as there are no similar functions.  
You do not need to use an argument with `syn.protect_gui` as it blocks ALL recursive FindFirstChild attacks.
